Project : 0x14. C - Bit manipulation 

In this project we will cover:

0. a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2. a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
